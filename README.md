## What is it?
People and communities that live in areas of social vulnerability tend to be disadvantaged when it comes to education. Private schools tend to provide a better quality education than public schools. We intend to model the Social Vulnerability index as a predictive factor in the ratio of public to private schools in a GIS tract. We suspect that this will show one of two things. Either the least vulnerable areas will have the most private schools, indicating that wealth is the driving factor in private school existence. Or the most vulnerable areas will have the most private schools, indicating that the wealthiest people in those areas are self-segregating. We will also search for temporally relevant data on High School graduation/dropout rates and college acceptance rates for GIS tracts to see if, as we suspect, social vulnerability continues to play a role in secondary and collegiate education.
